# Medicare_Data_Financial_Analysis

# The aim of this project is to access certain financial aspects of medicare for both patients and companies in the medical world
# Using advanced SQL and data visualization techniques I answer the questions of:
# 1. What is the average percent increase in medical care prices from the year 2011 to 2014 for any given medical care companies?
# 2. What is the average inpatient and outpatient medical expenses for patients in all cities throughout the US?
# 3. What is the most prescribed medical drug in all states of the US?

# This information provides a glimpse about how potential customers and medical companies should gather financial information in order to make both business and life decission.
# For example, what is the cheapest company local to you where you should go to get your check-ups? Or, what marketing devices should we use to target people who need prescription drugs?
